Lite customization of the example CameraWebServer (without facial recognition stuff, which for me decreased latency and lag)


To use the built in effects:


your static ip
 /       \
192.168.0.1/control?var=framesize&val=10

192.168.0.1/control?var=hmirror&val=1

192.168.0.1/control?var=vflip&val=0

and so on.
